\section{Personal information}
\cvitem{Nationality}{Croatian}
\cvitem{Languages}{Croatian (Native), English (Fluent)}
\section{Education}
\cventry{2017--2021 (expected)}{Ph.D. Astrophysics}{University of St Andrews}
{St Andrews, Scotland}{}{I am currently doing a PhD in Astrophysics at the University
of St Andrews in Scotland. This position is a part of a new scheme with a strong 
focus on Data Science and transferable skills. As a part of this scheme, in the middle
of my PhD I will undertake a 6 month internship in industry. The focus of my research
is on modeling gravitational microlensing events with a focus on exoplanets. I am 
primarily interested in probabilistic inference, Bayesian statistics and Machine 
Learning, both in the context of astronomy and elsewhere.}
\cventry{2015--2017}{M.Sc. Physics with Astrophysics}{University of Rijeka}
{Rijeka, Croatia}{}{Cumulative GPA: 4.7/5. I spent the first three semesters 
doing courses in theoretical 
physics and astronomy. For the last semester and during the summer, I worked on 
a research project at Lund Observatory in Sweden.}

\cventry{2012--2015}{B.Sc. Physics}{University of Split}{Split, Croatia}{}
{Cumulative GPA: 4.5/5. I spent the last semester of my bachelor's degree at
Lund University, Sweden. At Lund, I spent half the time taking courses and the other
half writing a bachelor's thesis.}

\section{Publications}
\cvitem{2018}{V. Bozza, E. Bachelet, \textbf{F. Bartoli\'{c}}, T. M. Heintz, 
A. R. Hoag, and M. Hun-dertmark.  \emph{VBBINARYLENSING: a public package 
for microlensing light-curve  computation.}, 479:5157â€“5167,  
October  2018.    doi:   10.1093/mn-ras/sty1791}

\section{Computer skills}
\cvitem{Programming}{My main language of choice is \texttt{Python}. I use it extensively together with
numerical/scientific libraries \texttt{NumPy}, \texttt{SciPy} and \texttt{matplotlib}, 
and \texttt{Jupyter} notebooks. I am also familiar with the probabilistic programming
framework \texttt{PyMC3}, which I use extensively, and machine learning 
frameworks \texttt{Tensorflow} and \texttt{PyTorch}.
Besides Python, I also use \texttt{C/C++}, and I have used
\texttt{C\#} and \texttt{MATLAB} in the past.}
\cvitem{Numerical}{I am familiar with some basic numerical methods used in physics and 
their 
implementation in \texttt{C/C++} or \texttt{Python}.}
\cvitem{Operating systems}{Linux \& Windows}
\cvitem{Other}{I use \texttt{Vim} as a text editor, \LaTeX  for writing documents, and
\texttt{VSCode} for coding.
I use \texttt{Git} version control system and \texttt{GitHub} respository
hosting service. I prefer to use open-source software in research whenever possible.}
