\section{Education}
\cventry{2017--2021 (expected)}{Ph.D. Astrophysics}{University of St Andrews}
{St Andrews, Scotland}{}{This PhD position is a part of a new scheme funded by the UK government
with a strong focus on producing PhD graduates with Data Science and industry relevant skills. 
In my research, I am primarily interested in building interpretable probabilistic models, 
using advanced statistical methods such as Bayesian models and Machine Learning.}
\cventry{2015--2017}{M.Sc. Physics with Astrophysics}{University of Rijeka}
{Rijeka, Croatia}{}{Cumulative GPA: 4.7/5. I spent the first three semesters 
doing courses in theoretical 
physics and astronomy. In the final semester I worked on 
a research project at Lund University in Sweden for 7 months.}

\cventry{2012--2015}{B.Sc. Physics}{University of Split}{Split, Croatia}{}
{Cumulative GPA: 4.5/5. I took courses in theoretical physics and programming. In the final 
semester I did a short research project as an exchange student in Lund, Sweden.}

\section{Research Experience}
\cventry{09/2017--today}{Ph.D. project}{
    School of Physics \& Astronomy, University of St Andrews}
{Scotland}{}{I am working on modeling astrophysical time series data 
using advanced Bayesian methods.
The main challenges I am working on is how to build 
probabilistic models of complex astrophysical
phenomena in order to extract useful physical information 
about populations of extrasolar planets.
These models are complex, non-linear, and have degenerate parameter spaces, a regime where
even the most sophisticated statistical methods regularly fail. 
The statistical methods I use in my research include Gaussian Processes, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,
linear models, and neural networks.
I am approaching the thesis project bottom-up, starting with simple interpretable models, solving 
one challenging problem at the time, and writing usable and scalable open-source code 
in the process.} 

\cventry{02/2017--09/2017}{Master's thesis project}{
Lund University}
{Sweden}{30 weeks FTE work}{
The subject of the thesis was to construct 
analytical and numerical models describing the dynamics of extrasolar planets.
I developed both an analytical pen and paper model, 
and used numerical simulations to understand the relevant physical phenomenon. 
The project involved writing \texttt{Python} code for 
solving symbolic equations and making plots, and interfacing \texttt{Python} 
code with a solver for differential equations 
written in \texttt{C++}.}

\cventry{07/2016--08/2016}{Summer research program}{Nicolaus Copernicus
Astronomical Center}
{Warsaw, Poland}{4 weeks FTE work}{I worked on astrophysical fluid dynamics 
simulations using a popular astrophysics code written in \texttt{C++}.
I spent my time running simulations and writing a data visualization code in \texttt{Python}.
I learned to work with Linux based computer clusters.
}

\section{Skills}
\cvitem{Programming}{I have extensive experience in \texttt{Python}, together 
with libraries \texttt{NumPy}, 
\texttt{Pandas}, \texttt{matplotlib}, and \texttt{Jupyter} notebooks. 
Besides Python. I have intermediate experience with \texttt{C/C++}, and have written
code combining Python and C++. I have used \texttt{C\#} in the past.}
\cvitem{Data science}{I use the probabilistic programming library
\texttt{PyMC3} extensively together with \texttt{theano}. I have implemented simple 
machine learning models in \texttt{Tensorflow} and \texttt{PyTorch}.}

\cvitem{Communication}{ I have given talks at conferences and meetings in academia, 
as well as talks to the general public. I have experience in giving 
tutorial to undergraduate students in astronomy. I have experience with
describing complex statistical methods to a lay audience.}

department and co-organising a meeting on coding.}
\cvitem{Mentoring}{I have supervised a summer student working on a machine learning 
project in astronomy.}
