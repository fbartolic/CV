\section{Education}
\cventry{2017--2021 (expected)}{Ph.D. Astrophysics}{University of St Andrews}
{St Andrews, Scotland}{}{This PhD position is a part of a new scheme funded by the UK government
with a strong focus on producing PhD graduates with Data Science and industry relevant skills. 
In my research, I am primarily interested in building interpretable probabilistic models, 
using advanced statistical methods such as Bayesian models and Machine Learning, 
and applying them to research problems in astrophysics.}
\cventry{2015--2017}{M.Sc. Physics with Astrophysics}{University of Rijeka}
{Rijeka, Croatia}{}{Cumulative GPA: 4.7/5. I spent the first three semesters 
doing courses in theoretical 
physics and astronomy. In the final semester I worked on 
a research project at Lund University in Sweden for 7 months.}

\cventry{2012--2015}{B.Sc. Physics}{University of Split}{Split, Croatia}{}
{Cumulative GPA: 4.5/5. I took courses in theoretical physics and programming. In the final 
semester I did a short research project as an exchange student in Lund, Sweden.}

\section{Research Experience}
\cventry{09/2017--today}{Ph.D. project}{
    School of Physics \& Astronomy, University of St Andrews}
{St Andrews, Scotland}{}{I am working on modeling astrophysical time series data 
using advanced Bayesian methods.
The main challenges I am working on is how to build 
probabilistic models of complex astrophysical
phenomena in order to extract useful physical information 
about populations of extrasolar planets.
These models are complex, non-linear, and have degenerate parameter spaces, a regime where
even the most sophisticated statistical methods regularly fail. 
The statistical methods I use in my research include Gaussian Processes, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,
linear models, and neural networks.
I am approaching the thesis project bottom-up, starting with simple interpretable models, solving 
one challenging problem at the time, and writing usable and scalable open-source code 
in the process.

\cventry{02/2017--09/2017}{Master's thesis project}{
Lund Observatory, Sweden}
{Lund, Sweden}{30 weeks FTE work}{
The title of my master's thesis
is \emph{Planets Orbiting Evolving Binary Stars}, and the subject of the thesis was to construct 
analytical and numerical models describing the dynamics of extrasolar planets.
In this project I developed both an analytical pen and paper model, 
and used numerical simulations to understand the relevant physical phenomenon. 
The project involved writing \texttt{Python} code for 
solving symbolic equations and making plots, and  
interfaced \texttt{Python} code with  a solver for differential equations 
written in \texttt{C++}.

I spent my time running simulations and writing a data visualization code in \texttt{Python}.
I learned to work with Linux systems  computer \& clusters.
