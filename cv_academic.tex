\section{Education}
\cventry{2017--2021 (expected)}{Ph.D. Astrophysics}{University of St Andrews}
{St Andrews, Scotland}{}{I am currently doing a PhD in Astrophysics at the University
of St Andrews in Scotland. This position is a part of a new scheme with a strong 
focus on Data Science and transferable skills. As a part of this scheme, during
my PhD I will undertake a 6 month internship in industry. My research
is on statistical modeling gravitational microlensing events with a focus on exoplanets. 
I am interested in probabilistic inference, Bayesian statistics and Machine 
Learning, both in the context of astronomy and elsewhere.}
\cventry{2015--2017}{M.Sc. Physics with Astrophysics}{University of Rijeka}
{Rijeka, Croatia}{}{Cumulative GPA: 4.7/5. I spent the first three semesters 
doing courses in theoretical 
physics and astronomy. In the final semester and during the summer I worked on 
a research project at Lund Observatory in Sweden.}

\cventry{2012--2015}{B.Sc. Physics}{University of Split}{Split, Croatia}{}
{Cumulative GPA: 4.5/5. I took courses in theoretical physics and programming. In the final 
semester I did a short research project as an exchange student in Lund, Sweden.}
\section{Research Experience}
\cventry{09/2017--today}{Ph.D. project}{
    School of Physics \& Astronomy, University of St Andrews}
{St Andrews, Scotland}{}{I am working on modeling gravitational microlensing events
using Bayesian statistical methods. 
The main challenge in this area is dealing with complex non-linear and degenerate 
parameter spaces, a regime where even the most sophisticated statistical methods regularly 
fail.
I am approaching the problem bottom-up, starting with simple fully
Bayesian models, solving one challenging problem at the time, and writing usable
open-source code in the process.

\cventry{02/2017--09/2017}{Master's thesis project}{
Lund Observatory, Sweden}
{Lund, Sweden}{30 weeks FTE work}{
The title of my master's thesis
is \emph{Planets Orbiting Evolving Binary Stars}, and the subject is exoplanet dynamics. 
The goal of the 
project was to see what happens to circumbinary planets as the binary star evolves
up to the \emph{common-envelope} phase. In particular, I looked at the
influence of mean-motion resonance passage on the stability of orbiting planets
as the binary's orbit shrinks due to tidal interaction. I approached the
problem in two ways. First, by developing an analytical Hamiltonian model 
of high-order resonances which can be used to estimate the change in eccentricity. 
Second, by using an NBODY code \texttt{REBOUND} coupled with a 
stellar evolution code \texttt{binary\_c}
to investigate the problem in detail and validate the analytical model.
The long-term goal of this kind of work is to put dynamical constraints on circumbinary
planet evolution during late stages of stellar evolution. This is useful because
given a detection of a circumbinary planet around an evolved binary we might
be able to say if it formed with the binary and dynamically evolved to its current
orbit or if it formed during the late stages of binary evolution.\\\\

\cventry{07/2016--08/2016}{Summer student programme}{Nicolaus Copernicus
Astronomical Center}
{Warsaw, Poland}{4 weeks FTE work}{I spent a month in Warsaw working on MHD simulations of 
accretion disks with the \texttt{PLUTO} code. During my time there I ran several 
non-ideal MHD simulations of accretion disks around \emph{cataclysmic variable} 
stars in order to investigate the stability and
structure of such disks. I also wrote Python code for visualization of the Pluto 
output variables in 2D axisymmetric spherical coordinates. 
The main skills I learned there are working with Linux systems 
\& clusters, using a modern 
fluid dynamics code such as \texttt{PLUTO}, and basic 
physics of magnetohydrodynamics in the nonrelativistic regime.\\\\

\cventry{01/2015--06/2015}{Bachelor's thesis project}{Lund Observatory}
{Lund, Sweden}{10 weeks FTE work}{
In my bachelor's thesis project, 
\textit{Tidal Evolution of Close-In Extra-Solar Planets}, I investigated the role
of planet induced stellar tides on the orbital evolution of planets orbiting
evolved stars. I wrote \texttt{C++} code which solves analytical models of
the tidal interactionto see how often planets spiral into
the star during late stages of stellar evolution and I compared my results 
with recent exoplanet observations. \\\\
